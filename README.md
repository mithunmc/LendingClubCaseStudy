## Conclusions
- We advise investors to approve more loans with purpose of wedding & major purchase since they have the lowest charged off percentage
It is risky to provide loan for small business & renewable energy, the small business have charged off percent above 25 percent while renewable have around 18 percent
- It is advised that investors must pay special attention to loan grade type as loan grade were directly related to charged off loans
Better  grade are were found to fully pay the loan.
Loan with grade D to G were having a charged off percent above 20.
- An interesting find was that, people going for 60 month loan term were two times more likely to charge off compared to people with 36 month loan tenure.
So an advise would be to go for Short term  3 year loan compared to 5 year  loan.
- People with no experience are twice as likely to default on loan as compared to people with experience
